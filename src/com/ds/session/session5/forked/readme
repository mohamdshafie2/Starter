This is a sample code majority of it was copied from apache licensed github repo
https://github.com/echothreellc/echothree.git
Directory  ( ./src/java/com/echothree/util/common/string/)
I copied then modified code in order to make it compilable.

the main objectives here are
1- to get a peek at real world util code. learning the syntax is not the objective, it is how it is used.
2- get a feel of how the pieces are tied together. The pain, beauty and uglyness of it all.
